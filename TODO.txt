- Make a UI (Electron? NWJS? Browser?)
	- Tabs, so multiple files can be open at once
		- Splitscreen tabs
		- Option to open them in their own window
	- Sidebar with preview of value of current type at current selection
	- 
- Add some caching mechanism to prevent repeated calls to functions that are unlikely to change. (Such as FileWrap#getSize)
- Add a method to read/write 64bit numbers
- Add a method to read/write 128bit numbers
-? Add a method to read/write arbitrary bit numbers? Would make this a whole lot easier
