- Make a UI (Electron? NWJS? Browser?)
	- Tabs, so multiple files can be open at once
		- Splitscreen tabs
		- Option to open them in their own window
	- Sidebar with preview of value of current type at current selection
	- 
- Add some caching mechanism to prevent repeated calls to functions that are unlikely to change. (Such as FileWrap#getSize)
- Add a method to read/write 64bit numbers
- Add a method to read/write 128bit numbers
-? Add a method to read/write arbitrary bit numbers? Would make this a whole lot easier
- Add search function to FileWrap. Perhaps load a multiple of the length of the values. You search for 0x0ABC it will load data in multiples of four bytes, searching for it. and return the positions of each instance.
- Make each EditStorage take a FileWrapper (or make so child edit storages know who the filewrapper is) and have them each have a save function that will hopefully be more efficient than the generic one
