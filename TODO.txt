- Make a UI (Electron? NWJS? Browser?)
	- Tabs, so multiple files can be open at once
		- Splitscreen tabs
		- Option to open them in their own window
	- Sidebar with preview of value of current type at current selection
	- Highlight sections with a color and text when you hover over them (stored as: [startOffset, endOffset, text] ?)
- Make the code more modular.
- Add method to get byte in binary to BufferUtil (so that it can be supplied to the user)
- Add funcs to get Float (32 and 64?) and Double in view data func
	- readDouble(LE|BE) say they read 64 bit double, but that must lose some precision
	- readFloat(LE|BE) says it reads a 32-bit Float
		- Thus a 64 bit measure should be made. Will have to use some big number library as BigInts are well Integers
- Make a function to get a lot of constant unchanging data (such as file size and filename), useful for stats
- Add BufferUtil func to get a byte as a string in different encodings, this would make so it isn't only ascii
- Have module functions that are only included if need be? It's not like they'll have much of an impact on the filesize/memusage if they're unused, so maybe not?
- Add a setting to View if it can unload (aka set the current loaded buffer to null and hope the GC gets it) while it's not being viewed
	- requires adding a variable that tells the View if it's being viewed that the UI Designer uses
	- Good for things like tabs, probably shouldn't be used if they've just minimized the window
UIView Ideas:
	-? Add a func to loop over buffer data like they're rows. (Like, how a UI might have space for 28 bytes, so it gives all 28 at once and maybe offset?) This would make it easier for ui's
- Add Find and Replace function
- Add regex option to Search (and Find and Replace if it's implemented)
- Add a function to expand file. Expand a file by X Bytes. Would need a special EditStorage code or something
- Add a function to fully delete part of file. Would need a special EditStorage code or something
- Add a utility function to get all values out of an iter and asynciter
	- Then implement that on the search generators to make a bit less repeated code
- Possibly load requires (for like path in filewrap which is only needed if you use the filename command) lazily, only loading them when needed.
- Add save as function, which updates the current file to the saved one. (Remember to clear idlesize and idlefilename)
- Make idle functions clearable. (Currently, you'd have to redefine them)
